**Journalysis** is a Revit journal, worksharing log and keyboard shortcuts analysis package for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.com) visual programming environment. It is currently being developed in Dynamo 1.3 and has **not** been tested with Dynamo 2.x.

# Documentation
This is still very much a work in progress. Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not always be up-to-date.

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals and worksharing logs for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage
