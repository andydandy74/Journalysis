**Journalysis** is a Revit journal, worksharing log and keyboard shortcuts analysis package for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.com) visual programming environment. 

# Documentation
Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not be entirely complete.

# Goal
This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals and worksharing logs for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
- Monitor crashes
- Monitor API errors
- Monitor memory usage
- Monitor sync with central duration
- Keyboard shortcut usage

## Sponsoring?
This is free software. I've created and maintained it on my spare time for a number of years now.
I don't do Patreon or GitHub Sponsors and I'm not planning to.
However, if you are using this software or have done so in the past and it has increased your productivity, please consider giving something back nonetheless. If you're smart enough to use Dynamo, you're most probably smart enough to know climate change is real, too. And I'd like to believe you're already doing something to battle it at this point. 

Do more.
