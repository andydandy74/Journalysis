If you're interested in helping with this project, I welcome the following types of contributions:

- Data that should be mined from a journal but is not yet supported by any of the nodes

Some simple rules for posting issues and pull requests for Journalysis

### Issues
- **When posting bugs: Describe what you were doing, what went wrong and what you were expecting to happen.** Include journals, screenshots and graphs where applicable.
- **Also when posting bugs: Describe your setup.** (Operating Sytem, Dynamo version, Revit version & build number) Do **not** post bugs that occur in daily builds of Dynamo.
- **Make sure you are running the *latest* Journalysis version.**
- **When posting feature requests: Go wild.** After all, it's just a wish, right?

### Pull Requests
- **Describe the purpose of your PR and what you have changed in the original code.**
- **Make sure you are running the *latest* Journalysis version.**
